Caesar cipher Encryption and Decryption

This python project implements the Caesar cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text messages based on a specified shift value.

##Overview

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This project allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using this cipher.

##Features

* Encryption : Transform a plaintext message into a ciphered text by shifting each letter by a specified number of positions.
* Decryption : Revert a ciphered message back to its original form by shifting letters in the opposite direction.
* Customizable Shift : Users can define the number of positions to shift each letter, offering flexibility in encryption strength.

  ##Usage

  To use the program:

  1.Run the python script caesar cipher.py.
  2.Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
  3.Enter the message you want to process.
  4.Specify the shift value
  5.View the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.

##Requirements

*Python 3.x
